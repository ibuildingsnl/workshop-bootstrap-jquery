    <h1>World of Markdown</h1>
    <p>
        Say goodbye to WYSIWYG editors! Welcome to the world of Markdown.
    </p>
    <p>
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

    <p>
        Sites such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users. A Markdown dialect is also used by the instant messaging system <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>.
        You can even use it when reporting bugs in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">JIRA</a>.
