## setup (vagrant)

If you don't want to install Node, Ruby, etc. on your workstation, you van use the Vagrant box. Make sure you have
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
installed, as well as [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html), and then run:

```
vagrant up
```

## setup (workstation)

First, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm).

Next, install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower).

Finally, install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install).

## exercise 1: set up Bootstrap for Sass

Start by opening the homepage, for the vagrant box the URL is:

```
http://192.168.33.88/app_dev.php
```

You can see that the homepage has no styling whatsoever. We will be using Bootstrap to fix this.

But before we can start installing packages, we need to initialize or npm and bower configs:

```
bower init
npm init
```

We'll be styling the homepage using Bootstrap for Sass, so we need a number of packages:

```
bower install --save bootstrap-sass
npm install --save-dev grunt
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-sass
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-watch
```

Now, create a file called `Gruntfile.js` and put in the following content:

```js
module.exports = function(grunt) {
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-sass');

    grunt.initConfig({
        sass: {
            dist: {
                options: {
                    loadPath: 'bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets'
                },
                files: {
                    'web/css/main.css': 'app/Resources/css/main.scss'
                }
            }
        }
    });

    grunt.registerTask('default', ['sass']);
};
```

Then, create a file called `app/Resources/css/main.scss`, containing the following:

```
@import "bootstrap";
```

If you run `grunt`, then you should see two new files:

```
web
└── css
    ├── main.css
    └── main.css.map
```

Finally, open `app/Resources/views/default/index.html.twig` and make sure the stylesheet is loaded as follows:

```html
{% block stylesheets %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/main.css') }}">
{% endblock %}
```

As you can see, the homepage now has some basic styling, but not nearly enough.

Before we start adding more styling, let's set up Grunt to recompile our scss code automatically:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    sass: {
        // ...
    },
    watch: {
        scripts: {
            files: ['**/*.scss'],
            tasks: ['sass']
        }
    }
});
```

Now, if we run `grunt watch`, and we change something in `main.scss`, Grunt will recompile `main.css` and we only have to refresh our browser.
